\chapter{Testing}
Consider how you will test your project. You should devise a test strategy that encompasses a range of methods.

\section{Test Strategy}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Unit testing (of individual functions)
    \item Integration testing (e.g. different modules/class files)
    \item Robustness (demonstrating defensive programming skills/exception handling)
    \item Requirements testing (against your initial requirements - a table with test number, description, test data, expected result, evidence (screenshot/video time link) would be suitable)
    \item Independent end user beta testing (this will assist with your evaluation)
\end{itemize}

\section{Testing Video}
\begin{itemize}
    \item You can include a video to assist (but you will need to reference the time point at which relevant evidence appears)
    \item If you include a video you will need to have it publicly available.
    \item It is suggested that you include a QR code in your testing to give a link to it the video (for the moderator) rather than just giving a long URL on its own.
\end{itemize}

\section{System Tests (against original requirements' specification)}
You need to give evidence in support of requirements that have been met e.g. reference to a relevant test/screenshot/relevant code.
