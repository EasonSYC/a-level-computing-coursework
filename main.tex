\section{Analysis}

\subsection{Background Information}

\subsubsection{The Early Earthquake Warning System}

Earthquake is one of the most common natural disasters in the whole world, and direct consequences of earthquakes include tsunamies which could be catastrauphic.

Japan, sitting on the intersection of the Eurasian, the Philippine and the North-American plates, is the countries with most earthquakes. Historically, the Great Kant\=o Earthquake in 1923, the Great East Japan Earthquake in 2011 (a.k.a. the T\=ohoku Earthquake) and the recent 2024 Noto Peninsula Earthquake all caused hundreds of deaths, both due to the result of the earthquake(s) and the resulting tsunami.

To provide protection to its residents, the Japan Meterological Agency (JMA), together with the National Research Institute for Earth Science and Disaster Resilience (NIED) placed thousands of \textbf{earthquake sensors} across Japan (the Hi-net), with several lying deep in the sea bed, measuring displacement, velocity and acceleration, which are connected to multiple servers, including two located in \=Osaka and T\=okyo.

Using data obtained from the sensors, computers do some complicated algorithms (mentioned below) to send out \textbf{early earthquake warnings (EEWs)} automatically within milliseconds. There are two types of EEWs:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{EEW (Forecast).} Sent out to \textbf{highly-dependent industries} (e.g. rail industry, power plants) and \textbf{subscribed users}, when maximum intensity level of more than 3, or a magnitude of more than 3.5 is expected.
    \item \textbf{EEW (Warning).} Sent out to \textbf{everyone} via TV, Radio, Mobile Phone, SMS, etc., when a maximum intensity level of more than 4 is expected.
\end{enumerate}

After the earthquake, JMA staff will determine the location and severity of tsunami warnings to be issued, if necessary.

\subsubsection{Earthquake Terminology}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Intensity.} The intensity describes the intensity vibration of a point due to an earthquake. It is not unique to an earthquake - \textbf{different places can have different intensities} due to the distance to the epicenter, and intensity will also change over time. JMA measures intensity using \textbf{9 levels: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5--, 5+, 6--, 6+ and 7} in increasing order.
    \item \textbf{Magnitude/Scale.} The magnitude of an earthquake describes the energy released in the earthquake in a logarithmic scale. \textbf{It is unique to an earthquake.}
    \item \textbf{Epicenter/Hypocenter.} The epicenter is the surface point directly above the true centre of the earthquake.
    \item \textbf{Focal Depth.} The focal depth is the depth of the true center of the earthquake.
    \item \textbf{P-Wave and S-Wave.} These are seismic waves, sourced from the true center of the earthquake, travelling at different speeds, with Primary (P)-Wave travelling faster and Secondary (S)-Wave travelling slower.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Problem Area}
The main goal of this application is to provide a visuallisation of the earthquake/tsunami related data feed(s) provided by JMA's affliated institution, Disaster Migitation Data Send Service (DM-D.S.S). There are numerous seperate apps providing a list of recent earthquakes, the real-time data measured by the sensors, and the real time earthquake warning displayed on a map, but rarely are there good apps that combine all those features together in a satisfying way, with just the necessary features the author needs.

Some applications are no longer being updated due to change in the user's policy of the related data feed. Furthermore, most of the apps avaliable are only in Japanese, not in English or my home language Chinese, which can create trouble for the author to understand.

\subsection{Client and End User}
The primary target of this application will be passionate geographers and geologists who are interested in the study of earthquake obserations and predictions. The age group of this vary all the way from primary-school students to adults, including the author who has been amazed by the technology since the age of 12. They could take any employment, ranging from students to full-time jobs. Their proficiency usually varies, since there are people new to this field who probably does not have much knowledge, so the interface of the applciation should be relatively user-friendly and understandable, hiding unnessary technical complexities.

Another target client could be industries which highly rely on earthquake predictions due to the risk imposed by earthquakes. High-speed railway and nuclear power plants are good examples of this. Therefore, the staff in charge monitoring will usually have higher proficiency and would like more detailed data of the earthquake. However, they will only need the necessary data from earthquakes happening close to them and only require intensity data of the point in interest (e.g. the power plant). To put this into content, an earthquake happening 1000km away from them does not need to be fed into their system, while they would like to see the intensity of the shock and the arrival time of the seismic waves to decide the actions. In fact, the author really likes investigating on the rail industry, whose infrastructure could be greatly affected by earthquakes.

Table \ref{table:users} compares relative features of these two target users/clients.

\subsection{Research Methodology}
\subsubsection{Client Interview}
The author interviewed my friend Wesley Ma, who is a passionate geologist on earthquake studies and also monitor earthquakes regularly.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textit{Which earthquake monitoring apps do you use?}

          \textbf{Response:} JQuake, SREV, Quarog, KEVI, Kyoshin-Monitor (Support discontinued), Kiwi Monitor (Support discontinued)

    \item \textit{Do you subscribe/pay to services such as DM-D.S.S. to use earthquake monitoring apps, and do you think it is worth the price?}

          \textbf{Response:} Yes. However DM-D.S.S. is a little bit expensive. However, the price becomes more affordable considering the information provided by the subscription.

    \item \textit{Do you watch YouTube livestreams on earthquake monitoring?}

          \textbf{Response:} I do not usually watch the live streams, as almost no one who has already has a monitoring app will use the stream. They provide mostly the same information as the applications, just real-time streaming the windows.

    \item \textit{Why do you use earthquake monitoring apps?}

          \textbf{Response:} To monitor the earthquake. This is derived from my interest in broadcasting culture in Japan. This eventually led me to be intrigued with the development of earthquake monitoring technologies and theories in Japan.

    \item \textit{How often do you use earthquake monitoring apps (e.g. all the time/after school/only after big earthquakes)?}

          \textbf{Response:} After big earthquakes. But I usually open one or two apps for all-day monitoring to catch potential major (or medium) earthquakes.

    \item \textit{Describe the advantages and disadvantages of each of them, mentioning the specific features.}

          \textbf{Response:}
          \begin{itemize}
              \item SREV is a good one, but it only available in a browser with no app.
              \item Kyoshin-Monitor and Kiwi Monitor are relatively more stable, but the source is not the same as that from the former two apps, and its support is also discontinued.
              \item Quarog has weak response time and interacting interface.
              \item JQuake is the most developed app, which includes nearly all functions that can be thought of. However sometimes the connection of WebSocket is unstable.
              \item KEW does not have the sound files configured by default. Some information are not displayed clearly enough.
          \end{itemize}

    \item \textit{What features do you use the most/least?}

          \textbf{Response:} Basic earthquake notifications, and should be including sufficient and prompt information.

    \item \textit{What features are redundant in the earthquake monitoring apps you use?}

          \textbf{Response:} KEVI has a weather monitoring function, which could be redundant. But that could be caused by the different purposes of the app. Hence, no further comments. It is not a bad thing.

    \item \textit{What are the critical features of an earthquake monitoring app?}

          \textbf{Response:} To provide accurate, prompt and detailed information according to the source released by the JMA, the information display interface should be easy to read and understand. This is not only helping the people who like to monitor, but more importantly, provides the easiest way to the people who really need to seek information to minimise the harm brought by earthquakes and successive disaster.

    \item \textit{What additional features would you like to have in those existing apps?}

          \textbf{Response:} Summarise all the useful features from different apps into one app. Stable connection. Nothing else.


\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Existing Applications and Solutions}

Based on the applications the author uses and the feedback from interviewee, there are the following commonly-used applications:
\begin{itemize}
    \item JQuake \url{https://jquake.net}
    \item Scratch Realtime Earthquake Viewer (SREV)

          \url{https://kotoho7.github.io/scratch-realtime-earthquake-viewer-page/}
    \item Kyoshin EEW Viewer for Ingen (KEVI) \url{https://svs.ingen084.net/kyoshineewviewer/}
    \item Quarog \url{https://fuku1213.github.io/quarog-site/}
\end{itemize}

Supported platforms of those apps are listed in Table \ref{table:exist-platform}. In particular, note that SREV is a web-based and GitHub Pages-hosted application therefore supporting all platforms. KEVI is written in .NET Framework and supports the second most platforms, with JQuake not supporting Linux and Quarog only supporting Windows.

\begin{table}[!ht]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{|c||c|c|c|c|}
        \hline
        Platform    & JQuake     & SREV       & KEVI       & Quarog     \\
        \hline\hline
        Windows     & \checkmark & \checkmark & \checkmark & \checkmark \\
        \hline
        macOS       & \checkmark & \checkmark & \checkmark &            \\

        \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Supported platforms of exsisting solutions}
    \label{table:exist-platform}
\end{table}

An overview feature table of monitoring is analysied in Table \ref{table:exist-monitoring}. In particular, note that due to the nature of SREV being Scratch-programmed and web-based, it reached a special agreement with DM-D.S.S. to use the API without the need of all users paying for this, since it is hard to integrate such function into a web application.

Quarog is a relatively new application and only supports basic functionalities of EEW Viewing and past earthquake listing, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:quarog-monitor-features}. JQuake is solely dedicated to earthquake and tsunami monitoring as shown in Figure \ref{fig:jquake-monitor-features}, while KEVI has features like rain clouds map and natural disaster warning which is beyond the scope of this analysis (which is a burden to users only requiring earthquake monitoring and a waste of storage space).

It is worth noting that for SREV, DM-D.S.S. is integrated with special permission with no login required. For JQuake, although it has tsunami warnings/special warnings, the tsunami forecast is not available.

There are also a variety of configuration options avaliable for all apps, as listed in Table \ref{table:exist-config}. Both KEVI and Quarog supports the adjustment of the colour theme, and Quarog even supports changing the style of how blocks are displayed and coloured as shown in Figure \ref{fig:KEVI-colour-cust} and \ref{fig:quarog-cust}. Playing a sound on the speaker is also common among the apps to remind the user of earthquakes.

% TODO: Include analysis on GUI

\subsection{Features of proposed solution}

Based on the potential user/client interview results, and the research into the exsisting solutions, the following key features should appear in the solution, since they are essential to earthquake monitoring applications:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item DM-D.S.S. Login functionality (for the data source)
    \item Real-Time Sensor Shake Internsity Data (w/ vibration alert)
    \item EEW Visuallisation (w/ Calculated Seismic Wavefronts)
    \item Past Earthquake List (w/ Option to review details)
    \item Tsunami Warning Visuallisation (w/ Related Sounds)
\end{enumerate}

However, due to the limitation of time and the difficulty of implementation, the following functionalities are not the key to implementation, which include mostly the customisation parts, ranked in decreasing importancy:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item User-Defined Key Monitor Point
    \item Customisable Sound Alert
    \item Customisable Colour Theme
    \item Customisable Map Colouring Style
\end{enumerate}

The following features might not be avaliable due to the time constraints and the complexity behind such system:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Replay (due to a server needing to store past data)
    \item Sub-Map for the Okinawa Area (due to the difficulty in implementatino)
    \item Map Zooming Feature (due to the complexity in the map colouring functionality)
\end{enumerate}

With those key features implemented, the application should mirror all essential functionalities of a earthquake monitoring application, as compared to the four exsisting solutions above.

\subsection{Critical Path}

The functionality of this application can essentially be divied into \(1+2+1+n\) steps, where the 1 is to receive information from the API/WebSocket provided by DM-D.S.S., and 2 is to, briefly saying:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Real-time Monitoring: Produce a real-time map to monitor real time vibration and plot real-time EEW/tsunami warnings
    \item Past-earthquake Viewing: Produce a menu to select an earthquake to display information on the map.
\end{enumerate}

The next 1 is to merge these two functions, specifically the functionality to switch back to the real-time monitoring option immediately when a new EEW is released (to make sure the user does not miss any information on realtime EEWs while looking at past earthquake information).

The final \(n\) is to implement a setting page for customisation, and some extra additional features.

\bigskip

\textbf{Part 1.} DM-D.S.S. WebSocket Connection.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Investigate into the list of APIs/WebSockets that should be used by the application.
    \item Implement classes/DTOs to convert the information into C\# objects.
    \item Implement classes to transfer real-time WebSocket XML/JSON to the classes and DTOs.
    \item Use simple API Key to test the functionality of this sub-system.
    \item Implement OAuth 2 login to reduce complexity and increase security.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Part 2a.} Real-time Monitoring Map.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Implement a Japan map in the application.
    \item Achieve and store the loactions of the monitoring points in Japan, using necesasry information from JMA and DM-D.S.S.
    \item Colour the monitoring points using a colour scheme on the map.
    \item Investigate into and implement an algorithm to detect shake in a certain area of the map.
    \item Achieve and store the names of areas of earthquake epicenters from JMA.
    \item Investigate into and implement an algorithm to calculate seismic wave fronts.
    \item Plot and display real time EEWs, considering special cases such as:
          \begin{itemize}
              \item Cancellation of EEW;
              \item Upgrade from EEW Forecast to EEW Warning;
              \item Multiple Earthquakes (hence displaying epicenters with labels).
          \end{itemize}
    \item Implement functionality of colouring areas on the map with the maximum expected intensity.
    \item Achieve and store the names of shorelines from JMA.
    \item Plot and display real time tsunami warnings.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Part 2b.} Past-earthquake Viewing.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Implement a side-list of a list of path earthquakes.
    \item Provide a button to view the detailed information on the earthquake (e.g. magnitude, epicenter, time).
    \item Implement functionality to plot the detected maximum intensities on the map, from where they are detected.
    \item Provide external link to view earthquake in the JMA website.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Part 3.} Joint functionality.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Provide sidebar to switch between real-time minitoring and past-earthquake viewing.
    \item Implement automatic functionatlity to switch back to real-time earthquake monitoring when a shake over a certain magnitude is detected, or an EEW/Tsunami Warning is being published.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Part 4.} Setting page for customisation and some more.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Implement customisable voice and sound playing (e.g. when EEW (over certain magnitude) is published, when an earthquake information detail is received, etc.)
    \item Implement customisable colour scheme for the colouring of different intensity scales, with several built in default.
    \item Implement key monitoring point with special warnings when a earthquake with more than a certain intensity is expected to hit that point.
    \item Implement a map-zooming feature.
    \item Implement a sub-map for the Okinawa Area.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Requirements Specification}

A detailed specification is defined here that is to be aimemd to be fufilled at the end of the project, split into four sections:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{DM-D.S.S. Functionality} -- Corresponding to \textbf{Part 1}, in Table \ref{table:requirements-part-one}
    \item \textbf{Real-Time Earthquake Monitoring} -- Corresponding to \textbf{Part 2a}, in Table \ref{table:requirements-part-two-a}
    \item \textbf{Past-earthquake Viewing} -- Corrseponding to \textbf{Part 2b}, in Table \ref{table:requirements-part-two-b}
    \item \textbf{GUI Design} -- Corresponding to \textbf{Part 3, 4}, in Table \ref{table:requirements-part-three}
\end{enumerate}

The objectives here are SMART, meaning they are specific, measurable, achievable, realistic and timely.

Note that those marked with an * means they are optional.

Table \ref{table:abbrs} for types of testing. [M] afterwards will stand for a necessary manual testing (i.e. specific user inputs), while (M) will stand for supplmentary manual testing (i.e. will have stand-alone tests as well as manual tests).

\section{Design}
Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs.

\subsection{Hierarchy Chart}
A top-down approach to problem solving will lead to the identification of tasks with sub-tasks. i.e. modules and functions required. This shows how \textbf{decomposition} is applied.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width = 0.5\linewidth]{hierarchy_chart.png}
    \caption{Hierarchy Chart.}
    \label{fig:hierarchy}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Data Structures/Data modelling}
\subsubsection{External Data Sources}
If you are scraping/gathering data from APIs from external sources you should define the relevant format/parameters.

\subsubsection{OOP Model}
OOP modelling (classes, methods, attributes, inheritance etc.). Class diagrams would be useful (these are covered in Bond book 1 page 185 onwards). Diagrams should follow conventions for inheritance/composition and private/protected/public methods/attributes.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width = 0.5\linewidth]{class_diagram.png}
    \caption{Class Diagram.}
    \label{fig:classes}
\end{figure}

\subsection{User Interface}
You will need to draw up a prototype for the user interface. You may do this within the software package you implement your solution in.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Screen designs
    \item Menu options/sequences
    \item Buttons/keys/commands (command line)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Hardware \and Software Requirements}
Draw up a hardware and software specification for items that are required.

\section{Technical Implementation}
\subsection{Key Code Segments}
\subsubsection{Data structures}
Implementation of ADTs and OOP Classes to be demonstrated.

\subsubsection{Modularity}
Code should be created and tested in separate modules that are integrated later. Use sub-headings for each module, define the purpose of the module, and show unit testing of the module.

\subsubsection{Defensive Programming/Robustness}
Exception handling

\section{Testing}
Consider how you will test your project. You should devise a test strategy that encompasses a range of methods.

\subsection{Test Strategy}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Unit testing (of individual functions)
    \item Integration testing (e.g. different modules/class files)
    \item Robustness (demonstrating defensive programming skills/exception handling)
    \item Requirements testing (against your initial requirements - a table with test number, description, test data, expected result, evidence (screenshot/video time link) would be suitable)
    \item Independent end user beta testing (this will assist with your evaluation)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Testing Video}
\begin{itemize}
    \item You can include a video to assist (but you will need to reference the timepoint at which relevant evidence appears)
    \item If you include a video you will need to have it publicly available.
    \item It is suggested that you include a QR code in your testing to give a link to it the video (for the moderator) rather than just giving a long URL on its own.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{System Tests (against original requirements specification)}
You need to give evidence in support of requirements that have been met e.g. reference to a relevant test/screenshot/relevant code.

\section{Evaluation}
\subsection{Requirements Specification Evaluation}
Personal evaluation
\begin{itemize}
    \item Copy and paste your original requirements from your project analysis
    \item You need to review each requirement and comment objectively on whether it was \textit{fully met/partially met/not met}.
\end{itemize}

    \caption{Table of Evaluation.}
    \label{table:evaluation}
\end{table}

\subsection{Independent End-User Feedback}
End user/client evaluation
\begin{itemize}
    \item there \textbf{must} be meaningful end user feedback
    \item You should hold a review meeting with your end user
    \item Write down any key feedback that they give you. E.g. Agreement that a particular requirement has been meet/comments as to aspects that they find sub-optimal/comments as to additions they would like to see
\end{itemize}

        \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Table of Feedback.}
    \label{table:feedback}
\end{table}

\subsection{Improvements}

You need to give consideration to a number of potential future improvements that could be made. They may arise from either your experience or from feedback given to you by your end user. Ideally at least one should be in response to end user feedback.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Write a paragraph for each potential improvement/change
    \item The improvements/changes could result from additional functionality that has been identified as being beneficial or could be as a result of required efficiencies if some processes are clunky or require faster run-times
    \item You should then comment on how the proposed change could be implemented moving forward. i.e. what would need to be changed/developed and how? You are not expected to actually make any changes; just comment on the possibilities.
\end{itemize}
